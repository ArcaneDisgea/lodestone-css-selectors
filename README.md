# lodestone-css-selectors
CSS selectors for The Lodestone.

## Character Profile (profile.json)

### Attributes (profile/attributes.json)
Attribute data is on the main profile page.

### Gearset (profile/gearset.json)
Gearset data is on the main profile page.

### Classjobs (profile/classjob.json)
Classjob data is on the `/class_job` endpoint.

### Mounts/Minions (profile/minion.json and profile/mount.json)
Mount and minion data are on their own `/mount` and `/minion` endpoints, and need to be scraped using a mobile user agent. With a desktop UA, the mount/minion names are
injected into the page with AJAX, and separate requests need to be made to get every single one.

### Achievements (profile/achievements.json)
Achievements are on the `/achievement` endpoint. Use the list selector to get the list of achievements on the page, and then get their IDs from the `href` attribute
of the link. Use the next button's selector to request the next page and scrape the next set of achievements until the href is `javascript:void(0);`.
